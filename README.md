# Elastic × Mistral NYC Hack Night

**NYC Job Match demo:** Upload a resume and describe what you want. Search NYC government software roles and connected NYC postings from 15 private employers, including Datadog, Figma, MongoDB, Stripe, Robinhood, Brex, and Databricks. Elasticsearch retrieves jobs and filters salary and experience level; Mistral plans searches and explains matches with source quotes. This pilot does not cover all NYC jobs.

Run `python -m nyc_job_match fetch`, then `python -m nyc_job_match`, and open http://127.0.0.1:8765 . Configure service keys through the UI or a local `.env`, then import into Elasticsearch. The default model is `ministral-3b-2512`, currently priced at [$0.10 per million input/output tokens each](https://docs.mistral.ai/inference/pricing). Use salary floor 0 to include new-grad and internship postings without confirmed annual pay.

TXT/MD/DOCX parsing is local; PDF OCR sends the original PDF to Mistral (5 MB / 20,000-character limits). Resume originals, extracted text, saved candidate facts, drafts, and records persist in local SQLite. AI matching sends text to Mistral. Model responses are cached for 24 hours, up to 128 entries; Elasticsearch still runs every search. Replacing, editing, or clearing a resume clears derived cache/drafts while retaining candidate facts.

The Datadog/Figma Greenhouse pilot prepares real questions and grounded draft answers. Optional BrowserAssistant requires Node.js, Playwright, and Edge; it attempts to prefill the official form, while the user reviews, handles CAPTCHA, and clicks Submit. Confirmation requires a specific official-page receipt; otherwise status stays unknown or self-reported. No actual application was sent to an employer. After a code update, restart the server; UI keys must be re-entered and are separate from saved resumes. Keep keys local. See [JOB_MATCH.md](JOB_MATCH.md).

Real job-source fetching, Elasticsearch/Mistral integration, desktop/mobile flows, and unit/integration/fixture checks were verified. Official-page browser prefilling remains a prototype: the live Greenhouse page timed out in headless testing. PDF OCR has not been verified with a real PDF.

Saved search subscriptions keep keyword, salary, and career-stage filters locally. Snapshot checks create in-app alerts once per newly matching job and exclude applied jobs; existing matches form a baseline. Checks require the local service to run and make no additional AI calls. Email and SMS alerts are not implemented.

Welcome to the **Elastic × Mistral NYC Hack Night**! Tonight you'll build something that uses tech from **Elastic** and **Mistral AI** to work with **open NYC data** — a search experience, a RAG app, an analytics pipeline, an agent, a multilingual voice agent - whatever brings your idea to life. Mix and match however suits your idea.

The theme is **New York City**. The city publishes an enormous amount of open data — restaurant inspections, 311 complaints, a squirrel census, live transit feeds, and much more. Your job is to turn some slice of it into something that reasons, answers, and surprises. Semantic search, a RAG chatbot, a conversational analyst, a moderation pipeline — if it combines Elastic and Mistral, we want to see it.

**Date:** October 7, 2026
**Location:** Elastic NYC Office
**Hack time:** ~3 hours

> **This is a hack about ideas, not interfaces.** We are judging how creatively and effectively you combine **Elastic** and **Mistral tech** — not how your project looks. You do **not** need a polished front-end, and fancy JavaScript or slick animations win you nothing. A notebook, a Dev Tools session, a terminal script, or Kibana itself is a perfectly good way to demo. Spend your three hours on the data and the ideas.

---

## Schedule

**5:00 PM – Doors open:**
Grab food and drinks, meet other attendees, and get settled.

**5:30 PM – Kickoff and demo:**
We'll introduce the challenge, walk through the tools, and share the starter resources.

**5:45 PM – Build time:**
Choose an idea and start building. Mentors from Mistral AI and Elastic will be available to help.

**8:00 PM – Show and tell:**
Share what you built with the room, no matter how finished it is. After the demos, we'll award prizes to the top projects.

---

## Judging Criteria and Presentations

Projects will be evaluated on:

| Criteria | Description |
|---|---|
| **Novelty** | A unique idea, a novel use of the data, or an interesting technical approach. |
| **Use of Elastic** | Meaningful use of Elasticsearch — search, aggregations, vector/semantic search. Agent Builder is a bonus, not a requirement. |
| **Use of Mistral** | Meaningful use of Mistral — its APIs, products, creation tools like the Vibe coding CLI, or the AI capabilities behind them. |

At the end you'll present what you built — no matter how finished it is. Show it off even if it's rough; that's the spirit of the night.

Some presentation guidelines:
- **3-minute demo** of what you built. No polished UI expected — a notebook, Dev Tools, a script, or Kibana is fine.
- Show the **Elastic** portion (your queries, mappings, or tools) and the **Mistral** portion (which Mistral tech you used and where). Those two, plus any accompanying tech, must be part of the demo.

**Submission:** Submit your final project on the [Mistral x Elastic Hackathon DevPost page](https://mistral-x-elastic-hackathon.devpost.com/?preview_token=tz74zdFHpy5jjL9JWIN2YChGi9WCsrYac4nL2mZ2ppE%3D).

## What you can build

Anything that combines **Elastic** and **Mistral** tech on NYC data. There's no required architecture -  approach it in the way that best suits your idea. You might put Elasticsearch at the center, call Mistral APIs from your own code and index the results, build with Mistral's tools and Elastic's side by side, or something we haven't thought of. Some starter ideas:

- **Start from Elastic.** Pick a dataset from the table below, run its ingest notebook to load it into Elasticsearch, then bring in Mistral: embeddings for semantic search, a chat model for RAG, OCR, Voxtral audio, moderation, an agent.
- **Start from Mistral.** Build a Mistral agent, an OCR or voice pipeline, or an app you vibe-code with Mistral Vibe, then bring in Elasticsearch to search, retrieve, aggregate, or remember what your app produces.

Either way, your project needs both, and how you combine them is up to you. See [open_challenge.md](open_challenge.md) for ideas, the [Mistral guide](mistral_guide.md) for building with Mistral, and [Using Mistral in Elasticsearch](using_mistral_in_elasticsearch.md) for wiring Mistral models into Elastic.

To get set up:
- **Elastic:** use a serverless deployment from the [Elastic Cloud Serverless free trial](https://cloud.elastic.co/serverless-registration?utm_source=github&utm_medium=event&utm_campaign=2026-10-07-elastic-mistral-nyc-hacknight-amer&utm_content=link).
- **Mistral:** see the [Mistral guide](mistral_guide.md).

> **Agent frameworks are optional.** Elastic [Agent Builder](https://www.elastic.co/docs/explore-analyze/ai-features/elastic-agent-builder) is a slick, no-code way to stand up a conversational agent over your indices. Mistral's [Agents API](https://docs.mistral.ai/studio/agents/introduction) gives you agents with built-in tools (web search, code interpreter, document library), function calling, and handoffs, and [Vibe Work](https://docs.mistral.ai/vibe/work/get-started) lets you run agentic tasks with MCP connectors in the browser. Use either, both, or neither. A RAG script, a semantic-search demo, or an analytics notebook counts just as much.

---

## Technical setup

You'll need two things:

1. **Elasticsearch Serverless (9.4+)** — [free trial](https://cloud.elastic.co/serverless-registration?utm_source=github&utm_medium=event&utm_campaign=2026-10-07-elastic-mistral-nyc-hacknight-amer&utm_content=link). A home for your data, and where Agent Builder lives.
2. **Mistral API key(s)** — We'll hand these out at the event. Install the SDK with `pip install mistralai` (or `npm i @mistralai/mistralai`) and call Mistral's models, agents, OCR, and audio APIs directly. The same key works in Mistral Vibe.

**How Elastic is used:** Elasticsearch can store and query an NYC dataset — full-text, aggregations, vector/semantic search — from a notebook, Dev Tools, your own app, or (optionally) Agent Builder.

**How Mistral is used:** Mistral provides the AI capabilities and the tooling: chat and reasoning models, agents, embeddings, OCR, speech, moderation, and the Vibe coding CLI. Call Mistral directly from your own code (see the [Mistral guide](mistral_guide.md)), or register Mistral models as Elasticsearch inference endpoints (see [Using Mistral in Elasticsearch](using_mistral_in_elasticsearch.md)), whichever fits your idea.

## Mistral capabilities to explore

Keep it open — these are prompts, not requirements. Any of these can anchor a project, and so can anything else Mistral offers:

| Capability | Where it shines |
|---|---|
| **Vibe coding & CLI** | Build faster with the Mistral Vibe coding CLI |
| **Agents** | Mistral agents with built-in web search, code interpreter, and document library, plus your own function tools (like an Elasticsearch query) |
| **Reasoning & chat** | Multi-step analysis, planning, summarizing, and answering harder questions |
| **Function calling & structured outputs** | Turn messy NYC text into clean JSON, or let a model decide which query to run |
| **Embeddings** | Meaning-based search and RAG over NYC text (violations, 311 complaints, squirrel sightings) |
| **OCR & Document AI** | Read scanned documents and photos, like the 1940s tax photos |
| **Vision** | Understand images, like City Nature Challenge observation photos |
| **Speech & audio (Voxtral)** | Voice-driven NYC assistants; transcribe street recordings |
| **Content moderation** | Flag or filter user input and dataset text |
| **Vibe Work** | Run agentic tasks in the browser, and plug in tools through MCP connectors |

See the [Mistral guide](using_mistral_in_elasticsearch.md) for how to get started, and [Mistral's docs](https://docs.mistral.ai/) for what's available.

## Public NYC Datasets

Suggested starting points — **you are not restricted to these, use any NYC dataset you find.** Most [NYC Open Data](https://opendata.cityofnewyork.us/) sets have a direct JSON/CSV API (Socrata), so they're easy to ingest (see [open_challenge.md](open_challenge.md)).

Each dataset ships with a ready-to-run ingest notebook in this repo — connect your Elastic project, run all cells, done. Starting from Mistral instead? Each notebook's data-fetch cell doesn't need Elasticsearch, so you can lift it out, process the data with Mistral first, and index the results when you're ready.

| Dataset | Description | Ingest notebook |
|---|---|---|
| **[DOHMH Restaurant Inspection Results](https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Health/DOHMH-New-York-City-Restaurant-Inspection-Results/43nn-pn8j/data_preview)** | Every NYC restaurant inspection: grades, scores, violations, cuisine, borough, location. Rich text + categories + geo — great for aggregations and semantic search alike. | [nyc_restaurant_analyst.ipynb](nyc_restaurant_analyst.ipynb) |
| **[2018 Central Park Squirrel Census](https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Environment/2018-Central-Park-Squirrel-Census-Stories/gfqj-f768/about_data)** | Field notes and stories from an actual census of Central Park's squirrels. Delightfully weird narrative text, perfect for embeddings. | [nyc_squirrel_census.ipynb](nyc_squirrel_census.ipynb) |
| **[311 Public Feedback / complaint types](https://data.cityofnewyork.us/City-Government/Public-feedback-on-311-request-complaint-types/7ffd-6gs9/about_data)** | Free-text feedback New Yorkers submit to 311. Ideal for semantic search and Mistral moderation (plus a pointer to the giant 311 Service Requests set). | [nyc_311_feedback.ipynb](nyc_311_feedback.ipynb) |
| **[MTA Subway Real-Time Feeds](https://api.mta.info/#/subwayRealTimeFeeds)** | Live train positions and arrival predictions (GTFS-Realtime). Real-time data for a live agent. | [mta_subway_realtime.ipynb](mta_subway_realtime.ipynb) |
| **[MTA Subway Schedule](https://www.mta.info/developers)** | Static GTFS schedule — routes, stops (with geo), timetables. Pairs with the live feed. | [mta_subway_schedule.ipynb](mta_subway_schedule.ipynb) |
| **[NYC 1940s Tax Photos](https://nycrecords.access.preservica.com/uncategorized/SO_d501be84-e09a-4023-bb8a-263aa8b0e04f/)** | ~720,000 WPA photographs of every NYC building (1939–1941), with block/lot signboards. A real-world **Mistral OCR** stress test. | [nyc_tax_photos.ipynb](nyc_tax_photos.ipynb) + [tax_photos_scraper.py](tax_photos_scraper.py) |
| **[SONYC Urban Sound Tagging](https://zenodo.org/records/2590742)** | Thousands of 10-second street recordings from NYC's acoustic sensor network, tagged across 23 sound classes. Great for **Mistral Voxtral** speech-to-text. | [nyc_sonyc_sound.ipynb](nyc_sonyc_sound.ipynb) |
| **[City Nature Challenge: NYC](https://www.inaturalist.org/projects/city-nature-challenge-2025-new-york-city)** | ~22,000 geo-tagged iNaturalist observations of NYC's wild plants, birds, bugs and fungi — each with a **photo** (and sometimes **audio**). The most multimodal set here: images, audio, and text. | [nyc_city_nature_challenge.ipynb](nyc_city_nature_challenge.ipynb) |

Mix datasets freely — e.g., join 311 rat complaints with restaurant rodent violations by neighborhood, overlay the squirrel census (or City Nature Challenge sightings) on subway stops, or OCR a block's 1940s photos and cross-reference today's inspection grades.

> **Tax photos need a scraper first.** Images live in the NYC Municipal Archives (Preservica), not a flat API. Run `python tax_photos_scraper.py --borough richmond --max 50` to pull a batch (images + `metadata.csv`), then run the notebook to OCR and index them. The scraper is rate-limited and sends a descriptive User-Agent — it's a city-government server, so be a good citizen.
